### Usage

Run the app and click on the voice button to activate Speech to Text. Speak and when the green light
in the corner has gone off (usually after a small break in speaking), the app will respond with the 
text. 

The data is written to the disk and can be extracted by connecting the phone to a laptop.

On Linux, the phone auto mounts. 

On a Mac, AndroidFileTransfer is a useful to mount the phone. 

Once you can access the file system, go to applications/uk.ac.uk.warwick.cim.voiceui and copy the
text file.

### Installation

The app is not available in any app stores. It may be downloadable at some point but at this 
moment, you will need to clone and build it.
