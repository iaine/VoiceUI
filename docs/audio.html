    <p>The RMS as an Audio Graph.</p>
    <p>This sonification used as a simple audio graph to represent the Root Mean Square values prodiced in a test.<br />
      It maps both pitch and volume to changing values as RMS shows the mean power spectrum of that sample.<br />
    The timing is based on the mapped sample times recorded in this experiment. </p>

    <p>Sonification of both streams from RMS and the binary as white noise.</p>
     <p>This sonification represents the Root Mean Square values prodiced in a test with white noise to represent the voice data.<br />
      It maps both pitch and volume to changing values as RMS shows the mean power spectrum of that sample.<br />
    The timing is based on the mapped sample times recorded in this experiment.</p>
